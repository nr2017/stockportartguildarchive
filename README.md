Personal Website:
I am an artist printmaker from the northwest of England that works primary in the medium of printmaking in particular intaglio and relief printing. My other passion is painting seascapes and landscapes in acrylics and watercolours inspired by a mixture of sketches and photography taken on my travels.

I am a member of Stockport Art Guild and regularly exhibit my printmaking and paintings.
