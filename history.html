<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; "><strong>1919 to 1929</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    The Stockport Guild of Arts &amp; Crafts was formed in 1919. Back in 1912 there were plans to </span><br />
<span >    build an Art Gallery in Stockport, and in 1919 it was decided to proceed building a combined War Memorial &amp; Art Gallery.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    The Stockport War Memorial </span><span >Gallery was completed in 1925, with a </span><span >final cost of &pound;24,000, which was raised entirely by voluntary subscriptions.</span><span >In those early days the Guild members met at various local </span><span >meeting halls as well as in member&rsquo;s houses, and as time went on began using </span><span >the Stockport Art School facilities for meetings.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    The Stockport </span><span >Art Guild was exhibiting almost from the gallery&rsquo;s inception. In 1929 the </span><span >Guild held its 10th Annual Exhibition in the gallery. For over 80 </span><span >years now the Guild has always held an Annual Exhibition in the same </span><span >Stockport War Memorial Galleries.</span><br />
<span >    </span><span >From the </span><span >minutes of the Guild Council meeting on November 10th 1929: It </span><span >was proposed that the sum of &pound;3 be paid to the caretaker of the Memorial </span><span >Buildings in recognition of his help and assistance before, during, and </span><span >after, the 10th Exhibition. In those days the use of the </span><span >Stockport War Memorial Gallery was granted by the local Education </span><span >Department.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    </span><br />


<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">    <strong>1935 to 1936</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    Around 1935/36 </span><span >the Guild&rsquo;s name was changed to the Stockport Art Guild when the Craft </span><br />
<span >    element was removed.</span><span > As the Guild </span><span >became more established there was a feeling within the membership that more </span><br />
<span >    space to display their work was needed. The following extract taken from the </span><span >minutes of the Chairman&rsquo;s address at the 1936 Art Guild Annual General </span><span >Meeting (A.G.M.) illustrates </span><span >the member&rsquo;s ambition to gain more display space within the gallery:</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    </span><span >Mr Scott said, <em>&lsquo;By the majority of towns-people, the </em></span><em><span >Stockport Art Guild is welcomed as a sign of aesthetic culture. In the past </span><span >there appeared to be some doubt with regard to the use of the Upper Gallery&rsquo;.&nbsp; </span><span >Councillor Kate Johnson had said, &lsquo;we should assert our position and </span><span >right to demand the gallery.&rsquo; </span></em><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    The Chairman went on to say that he looked forward to the </span><span >time coming when it would be taken for granted that we would have full use </span><br />
<span >    of all the gallery space.</span><span >As the guild continued to grow in members the whole of the </span><span >art gallery was eventually given over to the annual exhibition, and has </span><span >continued in this way only until quite recently, when the borough council </span><span >decided to restrict future annual exhibitions to the upper gallery only.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    </span><br />


<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">    <strong>1939 to 1945 (World War II)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    Even during war time, the Guild maintained its </span><span >activities, continuing to hold an annual exhibition at the gallery.</span><span > At the </span><br />
<span >    February 3rd&nbsp; 1940 Guild Council meeting, the Chairman, Mr Scott, </span><span >congratulated the Guild on having put up a show of work in the recent 20th </span><span >Exhibition which, in spite of war conditions, had maintained both quality </span><span >and numbers.</span><br />
<span >    </span><span ><br />
The effects of continuing War seemed to be having an effect </span><span >on the Guild&rsquo;s outside activities but the members tried to carry on as </span><span >normally as possible.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    At the A.G.M. </span><span >on February 21st 1942, the Chairman&rsquo;s remarks included the </span><span >following:</span><br />
<span >    </span><em><br />
<span >    &lsquo;Mr Scott </span><span >recalled the hopes expressed at the last Annual General Meeting, that </span><span >another year would bring a brighter outlook. Instead it seemed that the </span><span >Shadow of War was now deeper, but we should be wise to continue in our faith </span><span >that there were better things ahead, and in the meantime to carry on with </span><span >the Guild activities and with the interests of daily life.<br />
These activities </span><span >and interests helped keep us sane and fit for the War work which must be </span><span >done.&rsquo;</span></em><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    </span><br />


<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">    <strong>1950s to 1960s</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    During the </span><span >50&rsquo;s &amp; 60&rsquo;s the Guild continued to flourish and even rented its own studio </span><span >space, at 4 St. Peters Square, Stockport. Regular painting sessions and </span><span >demonstrations were held there and also the studio was used by individual </span><span >members to create their own work.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    The Stockport War Memorial Galleries were also allowing the </span><span >Guild to host regular studio evenings on Monday (portrait) and Thursday</span><span >(life) evenings. These studio evenings still play a large part in the </span><span >Guild&rsquo;s activities and are regularly well attended.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    It was at the </span><span >50th A.G.M. held on March 8th, 1969, that plans were </span><span >being made for the 50th or Golden Jubilee Exhibition. &ndash; from the </span><span >minutes, the President mentions the exhibition:</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    &lsquo;This year we </span><span >reach our half century of exhibitions. We want to make it something special. </span><span >Lord Bowden (of Chesterfield) will open it, he is a brilliant chap. He </span><span >disclaims any great knowledge of art but he has wide interests.&rsquo;.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    The 50th </span><span >Golden Jubilee exhibition was held on November 1st to November 30th </span><span >1969 and was a great success. </span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    </span><br />


<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">    <strong>1970s - L.S. Lowry &amp; the Guild</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    At the A.G.M. the following year (1970) the </span><span >President remarked: </span><br />
<span >    </span><span ><br />
<em>&lsquo;Our Jubilee Exhibition was one of our best. It compared very </em></span><em><span >well indeed with other societies. We can be justifiably proud. </span><br />
<span >    Lord Bowden proved to be a satisfactory opener. He not only opened the exhibition, he </span><span >also opened his cheque book&rsquo;.</span></em><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    An interesting recollection from a member has come to light. </span><span >On the occasion of exhibiting her very first painting in the gallery she had </span><span >an encounter she&rsquo;ll never forget!. In her own words:</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    <em>I will never </em></span><em><span >forget the day I met </span><span >L.S. Lowry. He was visiting Stockport Art Guild&rsquo;s annual </span><span >exhibition at the gallery at Greek Street (c. 1970). I had recently joined </span><span >the Art Guild and my very first painting, a pastel still life, had been </span><br />
<span >    accepted. I&rsquo;d gone to have another look around, as you do.</span><span >Cliff, the caretaker, came up to me. &ldquo;Hey Chris, have you </span><br />
<span >    ever met Mr. Lowry &ndash; he&rsquo;s in the gallery now. Would you like me to introduce </span><span >you.&rdquo; Well you can imagine&hellip;&hellip;!</span><br />
<span >    </span><span >Five minutes later we shook hands, then chatted and chatted.</span><span > &ldquo;Have you got a painting in the exhibition,&rdquo; he asked. </span><span >&ldquo;Would you like me to give it a criticism, tell me where it </span><span >is and give me twenty minutes, then come back and find me.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    Twenty minutes later I found </span><span >L.S. Lowry still standing in </span><span >front of my painting. He turned to me and said, &ldquo;If </span><span >this is your first painting, never stop.&rdquo;</span><span > I didn&rsquo;t think to get his autograph even though he kept </span><span >reaching for his pen, but this chance meeting with L S Lowry is mine alone, </span><span >worth far more to me than an autograph. I have kept that first painting.</span></em><br />

<br />
<span >    In the latter half of the 20th century the Guild </span><span >continued in much the same way, retaining a large membership and each year </span><br />
<span >    holding its annual show at the Stockport War Memorial Gallery. The number of </span><span >works on display, from around one hundred entrants, was typically </span><span >approaching 300 paintings &amp; sculptures, and these filled the upper and lower </span><span >gallery spaces.</span><br />

<span >Stockport Art Guild launches a new website in November 2005 which was created by Art Guild member <span style="color: #000099;"><a href="http://neilrobinson.me.uk/" target="_blank">Neil Robinson</a></span></span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">    <strong>2007 to present day</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span >    The Guild&rsquo;s long-standing arrangement with the gallery was interrupted in 2007 when the </span><br />
<span >    annual exhibition was cancelled by the gallery authorities. Although the </span><span >annual exhibition was re-instated the following year, it was now confined to </span><span >upper gallery space. This event had also coincided with the loss of the </span><span >annual prestigious Stockport Open Exhibition (This event has since been re-instated in 2011 by the <a href="http://skarts.org.uk/" target="_blank">sKarts</a> group), which had attracted interest </span><span >from artists in the region and beyond. With these changes many members felt </span><span >they now had a much limited opportunity to have their work adjudicated and </span><span >displayed to the public, and unfortunately for the Guild this led to a fall </span><span >in its membership.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    Membership is slowly recovering and the Stockport Art Guild currently has well in excess </span><span >of one hundred fee paying members as well as many life members. At the </span><span >gallery, studio evenings continue unabated, interspersed with demonstrations </span><span >and workshops by visiting artists are also occasionally </span><span >run locally. Regular newsletters and a brand new website relaunched in 2012 at <a href="http://www.stockportartguild.com/" target="_self">www.stockportartguild.com</a> </span><span >strive to keep members informed of the Guild&rsquo;s activities.</span><br />
<span >    </span><br />
<span >    Our association with the Stockport War Memorial Gallery has been greatly </span><span >appreciated over the years and the help and assistance offered by the </span><span >gallery staff, particularly around exhibition time, has undoubtedly </span><span >strengthened our relationship.&nbsp; We believe our long association with the </span><span >gallery has been beneficial to the area&rsquo;s residents and visitors and has </span><span >offered great encouragement to anyone wishing to pursue an artistic path.</span><br />
<span >    <br />
In 2019, Stockport Art Guild will be celebrating it's 100th year as an arts organization.<span lang="en-gb">
