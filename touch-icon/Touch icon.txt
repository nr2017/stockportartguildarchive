    Create your logo as a PNG image file. To support current devices the file should be available in two versions: 152x152px and 120x120px.
    Save these files and name them 'apple-touch-icon-152x152-precomposed.png' and 'apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png' respectively, then upload them to your webspace in the root directory of your website. Now insert the following code in the head area of your website:

<link rel="nr-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/nr-icon-120x120-precomposed.png" /> <link rel="nr-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/nr-icon-152x152-precomposed.png" />
